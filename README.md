# Biochemical-Indicators-and-Lifestyle-Diseases
This repository contains the research paper "Biochemical Indicators and Lifestyle Diseases: A Data Mining Approach", co-authored by Angel George, Brillia Benny, and Myself as part of the Master’s in Data Science program at Indiana University Bloomington.

🔍 Overview:
This study explores the application of data mining techniques to analyze biochemical indicators associated with lifestyle diseases such as cholesterol, diabetes, and hypertension. Using NHANES laboratory data from the CDC website, the project investigates risk factors and disease susceptibility through various machine learning models.

📊 Key Methods:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values using KNN imputation, outlier detection, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlation analysis, and bucketing response variables for classification.
Machine Learning Models:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for multi-class, multi-output disease prediction.
Decision Trees to analyze risk factors and interpret feature importance.

🎯 Impact & Findings:

Identified key biochemical markers linked to lifestyle diseases.
PCA revealed limited variance explanation, prompting the retention of all variables for analysis.
ANN models outperformed decision trees, achieving an F1-score of 0.6325 for disease classification.
The study highlights the potential of predictive analytics in early disease detection and personalized healthcare planning.
